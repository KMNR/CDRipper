KMNR Auto CD Extractor Tool (Name Pending)
Action Jackson <scj7t4@mst.edu>

==What This Does==

This software automates the operation of a Primera Bravo I. It is a python
script which sends commands to Primera's PTBurnServer software in order to
manipulate the robot, and uses an external program to rip and compress the
audio contained on the disc.

==Setup==

This software is currently implemented to be run inside a virtual machine
which has the PTBurnJobs folder provided by the PTBurnServer and a remote
storage site mounted in different directories. This allows us to use ABCDE
for audio extraction since it is the most automated solution we could find.
