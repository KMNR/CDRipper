a timeless classic
a triumph of modern engineering
the audiotory experience of the last 15 minutes
a life changer
better than a ham sandwich
not nearly as bad as it sounds
cool as a cucumber
shocking!
a lady killer!
the pinnacle of the 50's
the top of the 60's
the very best of the 70's
the cat's meow of the 90's
the absolute best of the 00's
the driving force of the 10's
definetly noteworthy!
does it get any better?
reminds me of Thursdays
reminds me of Tuesdays
reminds me of Fridays
reminds me of Wednesdays
reminds me of Mondays
reminds me of Saturdays
reminds me of Fridays
